# Introduction
Scheduler is a standalone Windows-compatible application created for the Macewan School of Continuing Education. It allows the user to create timetables for the students, based on given courses, terms, classrooms, and enrollment numbers.  

# Installation
Download the Scheduler.exe file from the dist folder onto a Windows machine. The executable can run without further installation by double-clicking on the icon.  

# Basic UI Overview
Scheduler is broken into two main parts: the left sidebar with various user functions, and the right side with three main tabs. The default tab 'Schedule' shows any created schedules based on user input (see Section Schedule Tab for more information). Furthermore, there is also an 'Options' tab as well as the 'Instructions' tab in which the user can easily reference this guide in-app. 

## Sidebar
On the left sidebar, the user can adjust the number of students either manually by program and term, or by uploading a pre-made template file to quickly populate predetermined enrollment numbers.
